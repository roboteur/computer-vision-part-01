# Machine Learning / Computer Vision Experiments Part 1
* These are OpenCV (Haar Cascade Algorithm) experiments with the intention to deploy it on the smallest device possible such as Pi Zero W.  

## SETUP
1. Download Anaconda for Python 3.X
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook

## CONTENT
### I. Cat Face and Human Face Recognition
* These are pre-trained models from OpenCV.

### II. Lemon Recognition
* These are customed models based on Kaggle's Fruit360 dataset.

### III. Tomato Recognition
* These are custom models and the images used are from real tomatoes bought in the market. The images are formatted to fit the requirement of the model.
